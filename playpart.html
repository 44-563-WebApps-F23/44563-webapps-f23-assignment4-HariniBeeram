        ENGSTRAND. It's the Lord's own rain, my girl.
        
        REGINA. It's the devil's rain, _I_ say.

        REGINA. Don't clatter so with that foot of yours, I tell you! The young
        master's asleep upstairs.<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. Asleep? In the middle of the day?
        
        REGINA. It's no business of yours.
        
        ENGSTRAND. I was out on the loose last night--<br>
        
        REGINA. I can quite believe that.
        
        ENGSTRAND. Yes, we're weak vessels, we poor mortals, my girl--
        
        REGINA. So it seems.</h6>
    <h6>REGINA. He's coming to-day.

        ENGSTRAND. There, you see! And I should be cursedly sorry if he found
        out anything against me, don't you understand?
        
        REGINA. Oho! is that your game?
        
        ENGSTRAND. Is what my game?

        ENGSTRAND. Sh! sh! Are you crazy? Do _I_ want to fool Pastor Manders? Oh
        no! Pastor Manders has been far too good a friend to me for that. But I
        just wanted to say, you know--that I mean to be off home again to-night.</h6>

        <p><class ="speech">You've said often enough I was no concern of yours.</class></p>
        
        ENGSTRAND. Pooh! Why should you bother about that--
        
        REGINA. Haven't you many a time sworn at me and called me a--? _Fi
        donc_!
        
        ENGSTRAND. Curse me, now, if ever I used such an ugly word.
        
        REGINA. Oh, I remember very well what word you used.
        
        ENGSTRAND. Well, but that was only when I was a bit on, don't you know?
        Temptations are manifold in this world, Regina.
        
        REGINA. Ugh!</h6>
    <h6>REGINA. Have you? That's a good thing for you.

        ENGSTRAND. What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country
        hole?
        
        REGINA. Well, what then?
        
        ENGSTRAND. Why, you see, I thought of putting the money into some paying
        speculation. I thought of a sort of a sailor's tavern--
        
        REGINA. Pah!
        
        ENGSTRAND. A regular high-class affair, of course; not any sort of
        pig-sty for common sailors. No! damn it! it would be for captains and
        mates, and--and--regular swells, you know.
        
        REGINA. And I was to--?
        
        ENGSTRAND. You were to help, to be sure. Only for the look of the thing,
        you understand. Devil a bit of hard work shall you have, my girl. You
        shall do exactly what you like.</h6>
