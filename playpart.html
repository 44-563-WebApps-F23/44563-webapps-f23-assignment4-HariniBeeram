     <h6>Ghosts Acts-1 (-Henrik Ibsen) </h6>
     
     <h6>In the newspapers there was far more obloquy than praise. Two men,
        however, stood by him from the first: Bj√∂rnson, from whom he had been
        practically estranged ever since _The League of Youth_, and Georg
        Brandes. The latter published an article in which he declared (I quote
        from memory) that the play might or might not be Ibsen's greatest
        work, but that it was certainly his noblest deed. It was, doubtless, in
        acknowledgment of this article that Ibsen wrote to Brandes on January 3,
        1882: "Yesterday I had the great pleasure of receiving your brilliantly
        clear and so warmly appreciative review of _Ghosts_.... </h6>
    <h6>"They say," he continued, "that the book preaches Nihilism. Not at all.
        It is not concerned to preach anything whatsoever. It merely points
        to the ferment of Nihilism going on under the surface, at home as
        elsewhere. A Pastor Manders will always goad one or other Mrs. Alving
        to revolt. And just because she is a woman, she will, when once she has
        begun, go to the utmost extremes."</h6>
    <h6> MRS. HELEN ALVING, widow of Captain Alving, late Chamberlain to
        the King. [Note: Chamberlain (Kammerherre) is the only title of
        honour now existing in Norway. It is a distinction conferred by the
        King on men of wealth and position, and is not hereditary.]
        OSWALD ALVING, her son, a painter.
        PASTOR MANDERS.
        JACOB ENGSTRAND, a carpenter.
        REGINA ENGSTRAND, Mrs. Alving's maid.</h6>
    <h6>REGINA. [In a low voice.] What do you want? Stop where you are. You're
        positively dripping.<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. It's the Lord's own rain, my girl.
        
        REGINA. It's the devil's rain, _I_ say.
        
        ENGSTRAND. Lord, how you talk, Regina. [Limps a step or two forward into
        the room.] It's just this as I wanted to say--
        
        REGINA. Don't clatter so with that foot of yours, I tell you! The young
        master's asleep upstairs.<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. Asleep? In the middle of the day?
        
        REGINA. It's no business of yours.
        
        ENGSTRAND. I was out on the loose last night--<br>
        
        REGINA. I can quite believe that.
        
        ENGSTRAND. Yes, we're weak vessels, we poor mortals, my girl--
        
        REGINA. So it seems.</h6>
    <h6>REGINA. He's coming to-day.

        ENGSTRAND. There, you see! And I should be cursedly sorry if he found
        out anything against me, don't you understand?
        
        REGINA. Oho! is that your game?
        
        ENGSTRAND. Is what my game?
        
        REGINA. [Looking hard at him.] What are you going to fool Pastor Manders
        into doing, this time?
        
        ENGSTRAND. Sh! sh! Are you crazy? Do _I_ want to fool Pastor Manders? Oh
        no! Pastor Manders has been far too good a friend to me for that. But I
        just wanted to say, you know--that I mean to be off home again to-night.</h6>
    <h6>REGINA. [Mutters without looking at him.] You've said often enough I was
        no concern of yours.
        
        ENGSTRAND. Pooh! Why should you bother about that--
        
        REGINA. Haven't you many a time sworn at me and called me a--? _Fi
        donc_!
        
        ENGSTRAND. Curse me, now, if ever I used such an ugly word.
        
        REGINA. Oh, I remember very well what word you used.
        
        ENGSTRAND. Well, but that was only when I was a bit on, don't you know?
        Temptations are manifold in this world, Regina.
        
        REGINA. Ugh!</h6>
    <h6>REGINA. Have you? That's a good thing for you.

        ENGSTRAND. What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country
        hole?
        
        REGINA. Well, what then?
        
        ENGSTRAND. Why, you see, I thought of putting the money into some paying
        speculation. I thought of a sort of a sailor's tavern--
        
        REGINA. Pah!
        
        ENGSTRAND. A regular high-class affair, of course; not any sort of
        pig-sty for common sailors. No! damn it! it would be for captains and
        mates, and--and--regular swells, you know.
        
        REGINA. And I was to--?
        
        ENGSTRAND. You were to help, to be sure. Only for the look of the thing,
        you understand. Devil a bit of hard work shall you have, my girl. You
        shall do exactly what you like.</h6>

        
        <h6>REGINA</h6>
        <p>What do you want? Stop where you are. You're positively dripping.</p>
        <p>[Regina was serious on engstrand and made him stop there where he was]</p>
        <h6>ENGSTRAND</h6>
        <p>It's the Lord's own rain, my girl</p>
        <p>[he said praises to the lord]</p>
